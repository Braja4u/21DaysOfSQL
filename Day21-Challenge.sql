-- Topics: WITH clause, CTEs, recursive CTEs (if applicable), query organization

-- ### Practice Questions:
-- 1. Create a CTE to calculate service statistics, then query from it.
WITH service_stats AS (
    SELECT
        service,
        SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_admissions,
        AVG(patient_satisfaction) AS avg_satisfaction
    FROM services_weekly
    GROUP BY service
)
SELECT * FROM service_stats;

-- 2. Use multiple CTEs to break down a complex query into logical steps.
WITH admissions AS (
    SELECT service, SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_admissions
    FROM services_weekly
    GROUP BY service
),
satisfaction AS (
    SELECT service, AVG(patient_satisfaction) AS avg_satisfaction
    FROM services_weekly
    GROUP BY service
)
SELECT 
    a.service,
    a.total_admissions,
    s.avg_satisfaction
FROM admissions a
JOIN satisfaction s USING(service);

-- 3. Build a CTE for staff utilization and join it with patient data.
WITH staff_util AS (
    SELECT 
        st.service,
        COUNT(st.staff_id) AS total_staff
    FROM staff st
    GROUP BY st.service
)
SELECT 
    s.service,
    su.total_staff,
    COUNT(p.patient_id) AS total_patients
FROM staff_util su
LEFT JOIN patients p 
    ON su.service = p.service
LEFT JOIN staff s 
    ON su.service = s.service
GROUP BY s.service, su.total_staff
ORDER BY su.total_staff DESC;

-- ### Daily Challenge:
/*Create a comprehensive hospital performance dashboard using CTEs. Calculate:
 1) Service-level metrics (total admissions, refusals, avg satisfaction), 
 2) Staff metrics per service (total staff, avg weeks present), 
 3) Patient demographics per service (avg age, count). 
 Then combine all three CTEs to create a final report showing service name, all calculated metrics, 
 and an overall performance score (weighted average of admission rate and satisfaction). 
 Order by performance score descending.*/
